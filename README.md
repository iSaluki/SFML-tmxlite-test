# A very basic SFML/tmxlite test

This repository contains a super basic test project. It uses SFML to handle drawing and user input and tmxlite to load a tilemap from Tiled.

There isn't very much functionality other than that, and it is unlikely that this repository will be updated much in the future, but I hope that someone finds this useful.

Please do note that I used this to begin learning SFML, C++ and tmxlite, so I may not have followed best practices.
